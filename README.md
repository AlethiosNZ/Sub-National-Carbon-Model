# Sub-National-Carbon-Model

This model was developed by Adam Jarvis of the Palmerston North City Council

The model:

  Takes a sub-national/regional/district wide carbon emissions inventory
  
  Forecasts future carbon emissions based on user-input scenarios

The model does not:

  Predict what the impact of a particular policy will be on an emissions activity (e.g. congestion pricing on travel demand) - you will have to make these determinations yourself.
  
  Claim any particular validity of the default scenario options.

A brief tutorial is available within the spreadsheet. A user-group has been established which runs regular catchups and conducts tutorials for new users as required. 
Please contact Jane.Palmer@boprc.govt.nz or Adam.Jarvis@pncc.govt.nz for an invite to this group.
